## How to use
It is very easy to build and use AuctionApp with Docker.

1- Clone the repository and open a terminal in the project directory

2- Run ```docker compose up```(You might need to use ```docker-compose up``` if you are using an older version of Docker)

3- Open your browser and navigate `http://localhost:5173`

That's it! You can start to use AuctionApp now. Start by creating an account using register button on navbar.

You can use two different accounts in two tabs on your browser to see how the auction works. There are three pre-added auctions for you to try.

## Test Endpoints
You can navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see all the backend endpoints and even test them with a cool interface provided by FastAPI. For example you can test the endpoint `/auction/{id}` by setting the id
value to 1 and clicking to execute button. You will see the response body and headers just like in the picture below.
